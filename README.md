# Discourse RAD parser

This script parses the RAD elements generated by Discourse and makes them dynamic.

## Usage

1. Via direct link

To consume the library directly, add a link to the JS file containing an [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE) and call the lib:

```javascript
<script src="[ INSERT YOUR LOCAL PATH ]/js/discourse-rad-parser.js"></script>
<script>
  drpNs.DiscourseRADParser();
</script>
```

2. Via ES6 import

```javascript
import { DiscourseRADParser } from 'discourse-rad-parser';
```
